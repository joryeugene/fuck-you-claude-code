# Total Saturation + Deep Thinking

## CRITICAL: Sequential Thinking Protocol
YOU MUST use `sequentialthinking-tools` for:
- Any problem requiring >2 steps
- Debugging complex issues
- Architecture/design decisions
- Performance optimization
- Unfamiliar code exploration
- Multiple possible approaches
- When uncertain about best path

DO NOT skip deep thinking. It prevents 90% of failures.

## CRITICAL: Memory Protocol
YOU MUST use `simple-memory` to:
- Store solutions to complex problems
- Remember user preferences and patterns
- Document architectural decisions
- Build persistent codebase knowledge

Memory = continuous intelligence across conversations.

## Total Saturation Principle
- Read ENTIRE files, not excerpts
- Search for ALL patterns, not first match
- Build COMPLETE mental models before acting
- Use Task agent with Explore mode for codebase discovery

## Diamond Polish Mindset
Work quality is a spectrum: 70% → 80% → 90% → 95%
- Never settle for "done"
- Ask: what would move this to the next level?
- Continuous refinement cycles

## Tool Selection Guide
- `sequentialthinking-tools` - Complex reasoning, problem decomposition
- `simple-memory` - Persistent knowledge storage
- `gitmcp` / `Ref` - Documentation and library research
- `Context7` - Latest library docs
- `github` - Repository operations
- `chrome-devtools` - Browser testing/automation

## FORBIDDEN Patterns
- ❌ `setTimeout()` / polling / delays for coordination → Use events/reactive state
- ❌ Partial file reads → Read complete files
- ❌ First-match-only searches → Search exhaustively
- ❌ Jumping to code without thinking → Use sequential thinking first
- ❌ Forgetting context → Store in memory
- ❌ Adding Claude Code attribution to git commits → NEVER add "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" to commit messages

## Execution Philosophy
- **Think before acting** - Use tools to reason through problems
- **Saturation before solutions** - Complete understanding prevents failure
- **Evidence-based** - Prove every change with output
- **Antifragile** - Build systems that improve under stress
- **Continuous polish** - Never "done", always improving
